	 * Single- One Parent One Child

	 * Hierarchy Inheritance- One parent has many child
	 * Multiple- Multiple parents have one class-->cannot be supported through  classes in Java (can be implemented through interface)
	 * because extend keywords support only one class not multiple classes because also there can be ambiguity among if there are same methods
	 * in the both classes. Even though we dont create a duplicate method,then also the problem is in Java when we create new class it extends
	 * from object class hence the common methods can cause ambiguity.
